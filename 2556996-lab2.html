            <p class="special"> Hi, I'm Shervaan but better known as "Shives". I'm a 3rd Year Computer Science student with an Information Systems major.
                Apart from immercing myself in the tech world, I'm an avid moroting enthusiast. I enjoy watching most motorsports, esspecially Formula 1.
                A new personal venture of mine was starting a media/content page called SBS Media, this is where I publish my photography of cars.

            <h3 class="special">My latest project was a competitive AI Snake project. This project used algorithms to predict the shortest path to an apple on a gameboard, 
                and make the calculated moves to get there, the catch? You were competing with other snakes to eat the apple and gain points.
